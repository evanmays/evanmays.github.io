<h2>Crypto Native Games</h2>

<p>
  You don't need crypto to play crypto-native games. That's the first thing i'll tell a layperson because it flips their understanding on its head.
</p>
<p>
  I don't like ponzies, but I think sustainable crypto-native games are cool. Emphasis on less gambling and more on new game mechanics for new ways to have fun.

<p>Making Fortnite skins into NFTs is not new game mechanics</p>

<p>
  New game mechanics come from different properties of the blockchain. It's not always about decentralization, but for some game mechanics it could be. Other properties to not forget are interopability, permissionlessness, credible commitments, and data availability.

  Here's a reading list that I feel aligned with

Here's the mechanics I've seen so far which wouldn't be possible w/o a blockchain. (or require too much game developer effort)
<ul>
  <li>
    User Generated Game Modes (A form of user generated content): Some games let users make custom game modes with customer rules (i.e. Halo), but once players can see the entire source code of your backend, they can make fundamental changes to the game. This happened in Dark Forest with DFDao creating Dark Forest Arenas. The normal Dark Forest game is a weeks long strategy game. Arenas is sped up in every way possible such that a match lasts hours.
  </li>
  <li>
    RPGs with real stakes: The real world has mainstream casino games where players bet real money and some become insanely rich due to their skill. There aren't any mainstream video games real money as a core part of the game. I don't think e-sports counts. I don't think chess counts either. Texas Hold-em is inherintly a game of money. Monopoly with betting probably counts. Wolf Game is a RPG set in a metaverse far from here with economic steaks. It's a game for the ultra rich. Some people play poker for clout and risk tolerance.

Incredible developer leverage

<p>I've tried to keep this piece purely historical, non-hypothetical. But, allow me to make one prediction</p>
<p>30 years from now, the largest casino in the world will be a crypto-native video game in the metaverse. Redundently, the logic of all games in the casino will exist purely on chain. There will be a layer of creators who spin up new casino games all the time and the community will compensate them.</p>
